My name is Brandon Lai! I'm a Junior in the IT Innovation major with a minor in Entrepreneurship. My focus is to use the utility of technology and the ubiquitous Internet to help the art community flourish. With my exposure to art, my love for it grew beyond what I had expected. So by combining the skills discovered in the IT field and applying to a community that struggles to achieve their own dreams due to many social anxiety, lack of publicity, and many other reasons, I hope to create an innovation that can leave an impact on the community while achieving what it means to be successful by my standards! If what I aspire comes true, I hope to invest in the very same community I sought to help in hopes that they will bring forth a new age of innovation.

This site shows how little I know about HTML and CSS. Hopefully, it'll improve in time!
