If you were curious enough to venture to the next page, here are some fun facts about me:

<ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 250px">
 <li>I moved to and from Omaha and San Antonio 3 times before high school graduation during my 4 years</li>
 <li>Since my last move, I've lived in Omaha for the past 6 years</li>
 <li>I've been exposed to architectural engineering, 3D design, 2D drawing, digital design, robotics, forensics, and programming classes since middle school</li>
 <li>I love to spend my time competing with my friends and online, whether it's board games or video games</li>
 <li>I've never learned Python before, but I'm also taking a C Programming class! I hope I don't confused the two this semester!</li>
</ul>

That's all I have for now! Return to the main page for the initial intro!

This site shows how little I know about HTML and CSS. Hopefully, it'll improve in time!
